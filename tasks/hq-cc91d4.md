Execute Task 3 of the proposed shared turn-pause plan, frozen in hq at 3c29183b042929a43619ab2b780527fad82dd307:docs/plans/2026-11-04-turn-pause-reliability.md. The design and this frozen implementation plan are explicitly approved by the user for native inline execution. Approval is recorded on the owning goals; live activation is separate. Read the approved frozen spec and supplied review guardrails cited by the plan. Native inline execution is recommended. Preserve focused RED to GREEN and mandatory hygiene under valid automatic_broad=false; never count a broad skip as a pass. Live hook/global activation remains separately gated. This is an agent-created decomposition of the existing owner task, with no new scope.

- 2026-11-04T11:51:37Z (fix/hq-2dd09b): parked (waiting on user, review): User reviews frozen plan hq3c29183b042929a43619ab2b780527fad82dd307:docs/plans/2026-11-04-turn-pause-reliability.md; after approval the agent executes this step in .worktrees/hq-2dd09b using native inline execution unless the user overrides. Live activation is separate.
